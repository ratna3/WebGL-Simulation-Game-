### 1. **"Undercover Agent"**
- **Setting**: Modern city

### 4. **"Corporate Espionage"**
- **Setting**: High-tech corporate facility
- **Role**: Industrial spy stealing trade secrets

### 5. **"Wild West Vigilante"**

- **Role**: Netrunner investigating corporate conspiracy
- **Mechanic**: NPCs are corp employees, street contacts, rival hackers. Wrong data requests alert security

### 7. **"Medieval Inquisitor"**
- **Setting**: Medieval village suspected of harboring heretics
- **Role**: Church inquisitor investigating heresy
- **Mechanic**: NPCs are villagers, clergy, suspected heretics. Wrong accusations create enemies

- **Objective**: Find true heretics without condemning innocents

### 8. **"Post-Apocalyptic Diplomat"**
- **Setting**: Wasteland settlements after nuclear war
- **Role**: Vault dweller trying to establish trade agreements
- **Mechanic**: NPCs are raiders, traders, settlers. Wrong negotiations break alliances

### 9. **"School Shooter Prevention"** (Sensitive topic - educational focus)
- **Setting**: High school with tension building
- **Role**: Guidance counselor or security trying to prevent violence

### 10. **"Time Police Detective"**
- **Setting**: Various time periods (time travel setting)
- **Role**: Temporal agent investigating timeline disruptions
- **Mechanic**: NPCs are historical figures, time criminals, innocent people. Wrong historical knowledge changes timeline
- **Transformation**: Timeline changes turn historical allies into enemies or create paradoxes
- **Objective**: Fix temporal anomalies without creating bigger paradoxes

## Core Gameplay Mechanics for All Concepts:

### Dialogue System
- **Multiple Choice Responses**: 3-4 options per conversation
- **Reputation System**: Track relationships with different factions
- **Knowledge Requirements**: Some correct responses need gathered intel
- **Stress Indicators**: Visual cues showing NPC emotional state

### NPC Transformation System
- **Gradual Hostility**: NPCs don't immediately attack - they get suspicious first
- **Group Dynamics**: One hostile NPC can influence others nearby
- **Redemption Paths**: Some hostile NPCs can be calmed down with correct follow-up
- **Escalation Levels**: Suspicious → Hostile → Aggressive → Combat

### Mission Structure
- **Investigation Phase**: Gather information through dialogue
- **Social Navigation**: Choose conversation partners carefully
- **Combat as Failure**: Fighting means you've failed the social challenge
- **Multiple Solutions**: Different dialogue paths lead to different outcomes

### Weapon/Tool Integration
- **Non-lethal Options**: Stun weapons, tranquilizers for de-escalation
- **Evidence Gathering**: Camera, recording devices, scanner tools
- **Social Tools**: Fake IDs, bribes, official badges
- **Emergency Weapons**: For when diplomacy completely fails

## Recommended Starting Concept: "Undercover Agent"
**Why this works best for your current setup:**
- Modern setting fits existing assets
- Clear good/bad guy distinctions
- Familiar FPS mechanics
- Easy to understand consequences
- Room for expansion with different mission types

## Implementation Priority:
1. Basic dialogue system with NPC mood tracking
2. Simple reputation system
3. NPC transformation triggers
4. Mission objectives and failure states
5. Weapon restrictions (non-lethal first)
